<p>BGP is a routing method that enables the internet to function.</p>
<p>Today, BGP is widely used to route IP traffic between large scale inter-connected networks. For example, when routing between corporate networks or connecting on-prem data center to a cloud provider&rsquo;s edge location, BGP is typically considered <em>de facto</em> protocol.</p>
<p>Before diving into BGP, let&rsquo;s start with a simple definition of network routing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>name</strong> of a resource indicates what we seek;</p>
<p>an <strong>address</strong> indicates where it is;</p>
<p>and a <strong>route</strong> tells us how to get there.</p>
<p><em>- John F. Shoch</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pre-bgp-era">Pre-BGP Era<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pre-bgp-era">#</a></h2>
<p>In the pre-BGP era when internet was much smaller, separate networks like universities usually each maintain its own static routing table - meaning the routing table on each network is manually updated by the admin and contains IP prefixes the admin is made aware of.</p>
<p>When the scale of internet grows, the number of inter-connected networks increases and the inter-network topology started evolving from a tree-like topology to a mesh-like toplogy to allow for redundancy and scalability.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Over time, those changes altogether made the static routing no longer a sustainable approach.</p>
<p>Another new type of construct that emerged is what&rsquo;s called Autonomous System (AS) architecture.</p>
<p>An AS can be an Internet Service Provider, a university or an entire corporate network, including multiple locations (IP addresses). Each AS is represented by a unique number called an <strong>ASN</strong>.</p>
<p>At first, AS became the new level that inter-network operates on and routes against. As the internet continues to grow, it calls for a new protocol that can dynamically exchange routes information and decides on the routes depends on many other factors.</p>
<h2 id="bgp-routing">BGP Routing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bgp-routing">#</a></h2>
<p>In June 1989, the first version of a new routing protocol, known as the Border Gateway Protocol, was formalized.</p>
<p>BGP operates on OSI Layer 4, in other words, it understands IP address.</p>
<p>BGP is primarily designed to exchange routing and reachability information between AS on the Internet but can be used on private networks as well.</p>
<p>For example, a dedicated line between on-prem data center and a public cloud service provider (e.g. it&rsquo;s called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/faqs/">DirectConnect</a> in AWS) can take advantage of BGP routing as well.</p>
<p>There are a range of ASNs that is reserved for private ASN. See <a href="https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/asn/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Every AS in BGP has its border router that speaks the &ldquo;BGP language&rdquo; and connects to other AS. Sometimes the border router is also called BGP speaker.</p>
<p>As of August 2019 there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">over 92,000</a> assigned ASN over the internet.</p>

<h2 id="bgp-security-considerations">BGP security considerations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bgp-security-considerations">#</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately BGP is not secure by design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the extent to which BGP is embedded in the core systems of the Internet, and the number of different networks operated by many different organizations which collectively make up the Internet, correcting this vulnerability is a technically and economically challenging problem.</p>
<p><em>- Wikipedia</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cisco has published an article regarding protecting BGP:<a href="https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/protecting_border_gateway_protocol">Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise</a></p>
<p>The main threats identified in the article above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BGP Route Manipulation</p>
<p>A malicious device alters the contents of the BGP routing table thus prevent traffic from reaching its intended destination without acknowledgement or notification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BGP Route Hijacking</p>
<p>A rogue BGP peer maliciously announces a victim&rsquo;s prefixes in an effort to reroute some or all traffic to itself for untoward purposes. For example, to view traffic that the router would otherwise not be able to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BGP Denial of Service (DoS)</p>
<p>A malicious host sends unexpected or undesirable BGP traffic to a victim in an attempt to expend all available BGP or compute resources results in a lack of resources for legit BGP traffic processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misconfiguration</p>
<p>Inadvertent mistakes among BGP peers can also have a disruptive impact on a router&rsquo;s BGP process. Security controls should be applied to mitigate impacts from such kinds of incidents.</p>
