      <description>SAML and OIDC What is the Real Difference Between SAML and OIDC
Both SAML and OIDC are authentication protocols and some times were referred to as identity protocols.
The basic login flow for both is the same.
A user logs in to the Identity Provider. The user selects which app to access. The user’s information is passed from the IdP to the user’s browser or other endpoint. The endpoint passes the information on to the application.</description>

      <title>A few basic Hebrew words you can learn</title>
      <link>https://davidxiao.me/posts/three-hebrew-words-you-can-learn/</link>

      <guid>https://davidxiao.me/posts/three-hebrew-words-you-can-learn/</guid>
      <description>Toda - Thank You &amp;ldquo;Toda&amp;rdquo; is pronounced basically &amp;ldquo;toh-DAH,&amp;rdquo; with the emphasis on the second syllable. This is important — if you put the stress on the first syllable (&amp;ldquo;TOH-dah&amp;rdquo;) it will make the word sound bizarre and may make it hard to understand you. It&amp;rsquo;s like pronouncing the English word &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;EE-nuff&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;ee-NUFF&amp;rdquo;.
If you want to express sincere appreciation, say &amp;ldquo;Toda Raba&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;Thank you very much&amp;rdquo;.</description>
